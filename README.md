### A Corona Tracking Mobile Application.

Corona Shield is an open sourced Corona Tracking Mobile Application with Back-end made by <a href="https://github.com/aminejafur" target="_blank">Amine Jafur</a> with :heart: using <a href="https://flutter.dev" target="_blank">Flutter</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JS</a>.


After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTQoi30OiIc" target="_blank">Najib El Mokhtari's video</a> about the government's  application project for COVID-19 tracking. And, since I had built a similar Bluetooth tracking application for the open-ended Hackathon 2015 by Screendy hosted @Casablanca, I decided to rebuilt the Application from scratch and this is what I came up with.

## Versions

First Verison of the APP : 1.0

## How It Works
1. First of all, download the App.
2. Open the app and follow the steps.
3. Signup using your CIN + Phone ( Make sure to have internet ).
4. Activate the bluetooth so the application can get your mac Address else you can enter it by your own. 
5. Once you're signed in, you will be redirected to the main page of the application, where you will get the Statistics and your profile details as a card.
6. If you opt to go out, Click on the tracking button at the bottom right corner and start tracking any collisions around you.
7. The app will keep tracking for any person you meet out there and it will save them in your phone using a specific encryption.
8. Let's say for example that you got the covid-19, the government will take your phone and it will be able to access the encrypted data from your phone using the List icon in the navigation Bar, they can also upload the decrypted data to ther servers to get information and find the persons you collided with in a precautions and safe manner.

That's All, Stay safe and Stay #home

3 - Open CMD, type : composer install, wait until the install is done then type : php dbseed.php ( you should get 2 messages, Starting Seed + seeded).

4 - In the same CMD type : php -S YOUR-IP:portShoosedForAPI -t public.
